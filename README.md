# Employee Management System

## Overview
The Employee Management System is a web application designed to streamline employee management processes such as attendance tracking, leave management, and performance reviews. This system aims to improve efficiency in HR operations while providing a user-friendly interface for both employees and administrators.

## Features

### 1. Dashboard
- **Overview**: The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key metrics related to employee performance, attendance, and leave management.
- **Statistics and Insights**:
  - Visual representations (charts and graphs) of attendance rates, employee performance ratings, and leave utilization.
  - Quick access to notifications for pending leave requests and performance reviews.
  - Summary of total employees, active employees, and leave balance across the organization.

### 2. Employee Management
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete employee records.
- **Employee Profiles**: Each employee profile includes personal details, contact information, job role, and performance history.
- **Role-Based Access**: Different user roles (Admin, HR, Manager) have varying access levels to manage employee information.
- **Search and Filter**: Users can search for employees by name, department, or job title, and apply filters to narrow down the results.

### 3. Leave Management
- **Leave Requests**: Employees can submit leave requests through a user-friendly interface, specifying the type of leave (sick, vacation, etc.) and duration.
- **Approval Workflow**: HR and managers can approve or reject leave requests with options to add comments or feedback.
- **Leave Calendar**: A visual calendar showing employee leave dates to avoid scheduling conflicts and ensure proper coverage.

### 4. Attendance Tracking
- **Clock In/Out**: Employees can log their attendance by clocking in and out through the application.
- **Attendance Reports**: Generate reports for attendance, including late arrivals, absences, and patterns over time.
- **Notifications**: Automated alerts for managers about attendance discrepancies, such as frequent absences or late arrivals.

### 5. Performance Reviews
- **Review Cycle**: Schedule periodic performance reviews for employees based on company policy.
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Define customizable criteria for evaluations, allowing managers to assess employee performance objectively.
- **Feedback and Goals**: Managers can provide feedback and set goals for employees, with options to track progress over time.

### 6. JWT Authentication
- **Secure Login**: Users authenticate through a secure login process, receiving a JSON Web Token (JWT) upon successful authentication.
- **Token-Based Authorization**: The JWT is sent with each request to secure endpoints, ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain functionalities.
- **Session Management**: The token can be set to expire, requiring users to log in again for security.

### 7. Cookies
- **Persistent Login**: Cookies are used to maintain user sessions and keep users logged in across sessions, enhancing user experience.
- **Cookie Security**: Implement secure cookies to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks and ensure the confidentiality of the JWT.

### 8. Middleware
- **Error Handling Middleware**: A centralized error handling middleware captures errors thrown in the application and sends structured error responses to the client.
- **Authentication Middleware**: Protects routes by verifying the JWT and checking user roles before granting access to certain endpoints.
- **Logging Middleware**: Logs requests and responses for monitoring and debugging purposes, helping in identifying issues promptly.

### 9. Error Handling
- **Structured Error Responses**: The application returns standardized error messages, including status codes and descriptions for various error scenarios (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).
- **Client-Side Validation**: Implement form validations to provide immediate feedback to users before submitting data to the server.

### 10. API Testing with Postman
- **Postman Collection**: A comprehensive Postman collection is available for testing all API endpoints, including descriptions of request types, parameters, and expected responses.
- **Environment Variables**: Utilize Postman environment variables for base URLs, authentication tokens, and other dynamic parameters to facilitate easy testing.
- **Documentation**: Detailed API documentation within Postman to guide users on how to interact with the backend effectively.
